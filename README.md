# 🎯 Google Shopping Scraper API

A minimal C# learning project that scrapes Google Shopping results and returns product data as JSON.
This project helped me explore web scraping, API creation, and C# REST APIs in a simple, practical way.

⚠️ Captchas are not handled; heavy usage may trigger them.
